# 🎐 Kelly's Portfolio 🎐
Welcome to my portfolio site repository! This is my first ever portfolio made after just four weeks of learning code and web development. I took on the challenge of creating my first portfolio from scratch, and I've been having a lot of fun making it. I'm picking up more about nuances and styles that I enjoy, so look forward to the transformation of my website as I dive deeper into web development!
